### Five features of my project

- My web page is built with React Router DOM. That is why it is possible to navigate multiple routes on a single page on my website without any reload.

- I used the Tailwind CSS framework instead of vanilla CSS for my web page. As a result I have been able to give many attractive designs to my web page. And  I have made my website responsive for all types of devices, so my website will look good on all devices.

- My project is Restaurant Management Website. We provide all quality foods for events, birthday, party or individual order.

- React Helmet has been used to make the head and title dynamic.

- JWT or JSON Web Token has been used to make the user authorization much more secure.
